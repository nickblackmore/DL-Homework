# DL-Homework

Assorted Projects and Homework assignments completed for my grad-level Deep Learning course at GWU. I primarily focused on Sequential models (RNN, LSTM) for my two personal projects. 

If the notebooks seem sparse it's because they were often accompanied by a report that explained the more intimate details of the problems and my solutions to them. Also all of the visualizations that I created using Plotly do not show up in GitHub's html rendering of the IPython notebooks ðŸ™„
