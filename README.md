# DL-Homework

Assorted Projects and Homework assignments completed for my a grad-level Deep Learning course at GWU. I primarily focused on Sequential models for my two personal projects. 

Please note that unfortunately all of the visualizations that I created using Plotly do not show up in the html rendering of the IPython notebooks ðŸ™„
